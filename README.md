# rogue-void-setup
Currently this script will get you into a working Gnome desktop and will give you a log in screen (gdm), but it doesn't set up many things like bluetooth and audio properly.
If you already know what you are doing and just want a little speed boost to a woking install this is ok to use, If you are new to this and don't know what you are doing, I recommend not using this(at least not yet).
I plan to make this a all in one just run and done script in the future, when its done I'll be sure to make a real README.
